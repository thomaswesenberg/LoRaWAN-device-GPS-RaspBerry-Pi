Preparation to connect to the Raspberry
=======================================

The Raspberry Pi Zero has no Ethernet interface and to connect a Monitor we would need a special HDMI cable. A keyboard could be connected to USB with an adapter, but we need this interface for the GPS stick.
So we do it headless, means we configure it to automatically connect to our WLAN and then we connect to the Raspberry via a SSH on the command line.

Download “Raspbian ... Lite” from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian

Unpack the file. Then copy the image to µSD card using a linux pc and µSD adapter.
  sudo dd bs=4M if=~/Downloads/*-lite.img of=/dev/sdx conv=fsync
Change sdx to the correct one, e. g. by using 'lsblk' before and after connecting µSD adapter or by issuing 'dmesg'.
Other possibilities e.g. using a Windows PC are explained at that web site.

Mount the µSD card (remove and reinsert) and add a file “ssh” to the boot partition:
  touch /media/$(whoami)/boot/ssh

Add wifi configuration (update SSID and PASS):
sudo nano /media/$(whoami)/rootfs/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  update_config=1
  country=DE
  network={
    ssid="SSID"
    psk="PASS"
  }

Change hostname (e.g. to 'rpi-lorawan-mapper'):
  sudo nano /media/$(whoami)/rootfs/etc/hostname

Eject the card and insert to the Raspberry Pi, then plug in power.

Use the command line to check access via WLAN (name must fit the choosen hostname):
  ping rpi-lorawan-mapper

If successful connect via SSH (password=raspberry):
  ssh pi@rpi-lorawan-mapper


Connected to the Raspberry
==========================

Update:
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade

Install GPS and Port library:
  sudo apt install libgps-dev gpsd wiringPi

Grant access to the serial interface which is connected to the LoRaWAN module RN2483A.
Update basic configuration:
  sudo raspi-config
    1 change password to “YourOwnPassword”
    3 B2 don’t wait for network connection during boot
    5 P6 no yes 
    Finish (use tabilator and select 'Reboot now'=yes)

We are now logged out at once. Relogin via SSH after waitung for about 30 seconds (use the new password):
  ssh pi@rpi-lorawan-mapper

The connected GPS stick should be listed:
  ls /dev/ttyACM0

Copy the 'lorawanmapper.c' file to the raspberry using an FTP tool. Then compile:
  gcc lorawanmapper.c -o lorawanmapper -lgps -lwiringPi

Run:
  sudo ./lorawanmapper

It takes some time until GPS fix is achieved, then the message to the LoRaWAN gateway should be sent out.
If everything is working fine the message should be received by the TTN application.
This requires a gateway nearby and the TTN account configured correctly.
Every 5 minutes the program should print out location data.

Now prepare for an automatic start of lorawanmapper:
  sudo cp ./lorawanmapper /opt/lorawanmapper
  sudo chown root:root /opt/lorawanmapper
  sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/lorawanmapperstart.service
    [Unit]
    Description=lorawan device script
    After=multi-user.target
    [Service]
    Type=idle
    ExecStart=/opt/lorawanmapper
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target 
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable lorawanmapperstart
  sudo reboot

If later you want to change the program and test it manually, stop the automatically started program first:
  sudo pkill -f lorawanmapper 

These commands may be helpful too:
  ps -ax | grep lorawanmapper
  sudo systemctl status lorawanmapperstart
  sudo apt install gpsd-clients
  sudo cgps -c
  sudo poweroff

What is missing here?
The filesystem should be changed to read-only to protect from file system errors resulting from unplugging the power while the Pi is running.
